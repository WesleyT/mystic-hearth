# 🌿 Mystic Hearth Enrichment

At Mystic Hearth Enrichment, learning feels like home — filled with laughter, creativity, and the joy of discovery.  
Our classes take place in our home classroom and garden spaces in Bulverde, Texas, where children explore through hands-on projects, cooking, crafting, coding, and connection.  
Enrollment is intentionally small to keep the calm, community, and magic that make our program unique.

## 🕯️ About Us

<div class="about-us-section">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/wes-and-jess.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Wes and Jess at Mystic Hearth" class="about-us-photo">
  <div class="about-us-text">
    <p>
      We’re <strong>Wes and Jessica</strong> — a blended family of eight with hearts full of curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning through life itself. With six kids between us, we’ve spent years exploring what education can look like beyond the traditional classroom — one rooted in hands-on discovery, imagination, and connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wes was homeschooled growing up and dreamed of creating a space where learning could happen beyond four walls — where kids could tinker, build, and experiment while feeling free to explore the world around them. With his background in electrical engineering and computer programming, he brings a love of innovation, robotics, and problem-solving to our classes, showing students how creativity and technology work hand in hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jessica’s roots are in musical theater and the culinary arts, where storytelling, rhythm, and flavor all intertwine. As a former private chef and lifelong creative, she brings heart and artistry to Mystic Hearth — helping students discover the beauty in creating with their hands, finding their voice, and sharing in the joy of community. Her passion is teaching life skills that nourish both body and spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, we wanted to build a program that combines the heart of home with the wonder of discovery — a place where children can explore, create, and grow through the rhythm of the seasons.

## ✨ The Rhythm of the Year

At Mystic Hearth, our classes flow with the turning of the seasons.  
Each six-week session celebrates a moment in nature’s cycle — from the first harvest of autumn to the bright energy of midsummer.  
These rhythms give students a natural sense of progress and renewal while giving families time to rest between sessions.

Children learn to see themselves as part of the living world: planting, building, creating, and sharing in harmony with the wheel of the year.

## 🌱 About the Classes

Children learn best when they’re doing — baking, building, crafting, and creating through the rhythm of the year.  
Each six-week session blends art, science, and life skills in small, hands-on groups that nurture confidence, creativity, and connection.  
🪄 *All materials included. Full-day students bring a bag lunch for the 12–1 break.*

### 🌿 Sprouts  
**Ages 6–10** · *Tuesdays 10–12 or 1–3* · 💲**150 / 6 weeks**

Curiosity takes root in our youngest learners.  
Children explore the joy of making — kneading dough, planting seeds, painting, and experimenting — building confidence, imagination, and teamwork through simple projects that connect art, nature, and science.

---

### 🔥 Seekers  
**Ages 10–14** · *Wednesdays 10–12 or 1–3* · 💲**150 single session / 250 full day (includes both)**

Seekers are explorers — diving deeper into how things work and how creativity takes shape.  
Mornings focus on cooking, gardening, and creative arts; afternoons turn toward coding, crafting, and invention.  
Each week blends art, science, and storytelling, helping students connect curiosity to real-world skills.

---

### 🌙 Pathfinders  
**Ages 14–18** · *Thursdays 10–12 or 1–3* · 💲**150 single session / 250 full day (includes both)**

Pathfinders continue the same rhythm as Seekers, but with greater independence and complexity.  
They take on projects that require planning, collaboration, and creative problem-solving — discovering how their unique strengths help the whole team thrive.  
Cooking, crafting, design, and innovation all weave together as they learn to turn ideas into action.
