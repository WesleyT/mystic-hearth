# Mystic Hearth Enrichment

At Mystic Hearth Enrichment, learning feels like home — filled with laughter, creativity, and the joy of discovery.  
Our classes take place in our home classroom and garden spaces in Bulverde, Texas, where children explore through hands-on projects, cooking, crafting, coding, and connection.  
Enrollment is intentionally small to keep the calm, community, and magic that make our program unique.

## About Us

<div class="about-us-section">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/wes-and-jess.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Wes and Jess at Mystic Hearth" class="about-us-photo">
  <div class="about-us-text">
    <p>
      We’re <strong>Wes and Jessica</strong> — a blended family of eight with hearts full of curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning through life itself. With six kids between us, we’ve spent years exploring what education can look like beyond the traditional classroom — one rooted in hands-on discovery, imagination, and connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wes was homeschooled growing up and dreamed of creating a space where learning could happen beyond four walls — where kids could tinker, build, and experiment while feeling free to explore the world around them. With his background in electrical engineering and computer programming, he brings a love of innovation, robotics, and problem-solving to our classes, showing students how creativity and technology work hand in hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jessica’s roots are in musical theater and the culinary arts, where storytelling, rhythm, and flavor all intertwine. As a former private chef and lifelong creative, she brings heart and artistry to Mystic Hearth — helping students discover the beauty in creating with their hands, finding their voice, and sharing in the joy of community. Her passion is teaching life skills that nourish both body and spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, we wanted to build a program that combines the heart of home with the wonder of discovery — a place where children can explore, create, and grow through the rhythm of the seasons.

## The Rhythm of the Year

At Mystic Hearth, our classes flow with the turning of the seasons.  
Each six-week session celebrates a moment in nature’s cycle — from the first harvest of autumn to the bright energy of midsummer.  
These rhythms give students a natural sense of progress and renewal while giving families time to rest between sessions.

Children learn to see themselves as part of the living world: planting, building, creating, and sharing in harmony with the wheel of the year.

## About the Classes

Children learn best when they’re doing, baking, building, crafting, and creating through the rhythm of the year.  
Each six-week session blends art, science, and life skills in small, hands-on groups that nurture confidence, creativity, and connection.  
🪄 *All materials included.*

### How the Day Works
Every class follows the same simple rhythm. Mornings are for cooking, gardening, and creative arts. 
Afternoons shift toward building, engineering, and invention. 
Students can join for morning only, afternoon only, or stay for the full day, whatever fits your family best. 

**Half Day**
AM 10am-12pm
PM 1pm-3pm

**Full Day** 
10am-3pm
*Full-day students bring a bag lunch for the 12–1 break.*

💲**150 half day / 250 full day**

### Who we are for
Mystic Hearth is small on purpose. We're relationship-based, flexible, and built for kids who haven't always felt like they fit — whether that's in a traditional classroom, a structured program, or just the world in general.

Kids here move at their own pace, take breaks when they need to, and engage socially in whatever way feels natural to them. Some dive into group projects. Some prefer to work alongside others quietly. Both are completely fine.

We’ve found that hands-on learning (gardening, cooking, crafting, building) often allows our students to thrive because it engages the body and the senses, not just the abstract mind.

We focus on connection first. Everything else follows.

### Classes  
**Sprouts** · **Ages 6–10** · *Tuesdays* · 

**Seekers** · **Ages 10–14** · *Wednesdays* · 

**Smiths** · **Ages 14–18** · *Wednesdays* · 
*Currently combined with Seekers while enrollment grows*

## 🌷 Spring Break Hearth Camp
**March 9–13, 2026 (Monday–Friday)**

Our **Spring Break Hearth Camp** is a cozy, hands-on week of learning, creativity, and connection for children ages **5–11**.

Held **Monday–Friday from 10:00–3:00**, campers spend their days immersed in the rhythms of the hearth — baking, cooking, crafting, gardening, and simple engineering projects — all woven together through seasonal themes and guided exploration. Each day balances gentle structure with plenty of space for curiosity, imagination, and play.

This camp is designed to feel like an extension of home: warm, welcoming, and intentional. Children work in small mixed-age groups, build confidence through real skills, and experience the joy of creating with their hands while learning alongside peers.

**Cost**
- **$250** for the week (10:00–3:00)
- **$300** with early drop-off and/or late pick-up

*Early drop-off and late pick-up provide supervised, relaxed time outside of camp hours. No formal activities or curriculum are scheduled during these periods.*

Whether your child loves getting messy in the kitchen, building and experimenting, or simply being outdoors and engaged, Spring Break Hearth Camp offers a meaningful and memorable way to spend the week.

*Space is limited to keep our camp experience personal and connected.*
