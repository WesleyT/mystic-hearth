# 🧺 Mystic Hearth Apothecary  

Welcome to the heart of our craft — where herbs, candles, soil, and baked creations come together with care and story.  
Each item in the **Mystic Hearth Apothecary** is hand-blended, poured, or baked in our home workshop, using natural materials, warm spices, and a touch of enchantment.

## 🌿 Our Philosophy  

The Apothecary is more than a shop — it’s a living expression of the same rhythm we teach and live by:  
the turning of the seasons, the balance of the elements, and the art of making with intention.  

We believe that everyday rituals — lighting a candle, kneading dough, watering a plant —  
are acts of grounding and quiet magic.  

Everything we make follows one simple rule:  
> **If we wouldn’t use it, eat it, or gift it in our own home, it doesn’t belong on our table.**

## 🕯️ What You’ll Find  

Our shelves change with the seasons, but you can usually find:

- **Hand-poured candles** in scent blends that tell stories — *Tavern, Apothecary, Bed & Breakfast, Hearth, Forest, and Moonlight.*  
- **Seasonal baked goods** — comforting breads, cookies, and pastries inspired by the time of year, often infused with herbs and spices from our garden.  
- **Plant magic** — from rooted cuttings and soil blends to macramé hangers and handmade planters.  
- **Sanctuary Soil** — our signature indoor potting blend, crafted from pine bark, coconut coir, and lava rock for thriving, balanced soil.  
- **Seasonal ritual kits** — small bundles for reflection and celebration, aligned with the wheel of the year.

Every blend, loaf, and candle is labeled by hand, with its story included —  
because we believe what you hold (and taste) should feel *alive* with meaning.
