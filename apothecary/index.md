# Mystic Hearth Apothecary

Step into our booth and you’ll find a welcoming mix of items meant to make you feel at home. The first thing you’ll notice is the aroma-soft, grounding scents that invite you to slow down for a moment. The sparkle of gemstones always catches the eyes of kids and adults alike, a little reminder of the quiet wonders found in nature.

Our baked goods are prepared fresh for the day’s market, offering flavors that feel familiar and comforting. And, of course, you’ll see plenty of plants-greenery that brings life, color, and warmth to any space.

Everything at our table is chosen to help you feel grounded, cozy, and connected. It’s a small traveling hearth, made to make you feel welcome.

## Baked Goods

<div class="mh-section">
  <div class="mh-text">
    <p>
      Our baked table changes with the season and from market to market. We keep the lineup small
      and focused, so everything feels fresh and intentional instead of overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>You’ll often find a mix of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mini loaves (like cranberry orange or other seasonal flavors)</li>
      <li>Artisan bread loaves for sharing at home</li>
      <li>Soft cookies and other rotating treats</li>
      <li>Our signature Traveler Waffles (see below)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We bake in small batches for each market day, and once something sells out, it’s gone until
      the next time it comes back into the rotation.

### Feature Item: Traveler Waffles

<div class="mh-section mh-reverse">
  <div class="mh-text">
    <p>
      Our <strong>Traveler Waffle</strong> is our signature item — crisp on the outside, soft on the inside,
      and easy to enjoy as you walk the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each season we decorate them differently, using chocolate dips, glazes, sprinkles, and colors that
      match the time of year or the theme of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also offer <strong>custom-decorated waffles</strong> for private events, parties, and gatherings.
      Reach out if you’d like something special designed for your occasion.

## Our Promise

Our table is filled with things we love and stand behind — items we use, enjoy, and would happily gift.  
If it doesn’t feel like it belongs in our own home, it doesn’t make it to the hearth.
