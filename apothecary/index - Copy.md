# 🕯️ The Mystic Hearth Apothecary  

Cozy scents, fiber magic, baked goods, herbs & teas — this is the table we bring out into the world.  
Everything here is made or grown at home, in small batches, with the same care we’d use for our own family.

At each market you’ll usually find a little of everything we love:  
warm bread, steeping tea, happy plants, incense smoke curling in the air, and a table full of small treasures.

## 🥖 Baked Goods & Sweet Things  

![Mystic Hearth baked goods display](/assets/images/market/baked-table.jpg)

All of our baked goods are made in our home kitchen and brought fresh to each market.

You might find:

- **Cranberry Orange Mini Loaves** – tender, citrusy loaves perfect with tea.
- **House Breads** – rustic loaves and boules with chewy crusts and soft centers.
- **Market Cookies** – simple, cozy flavors that travel well.
- **Chocolate-Dipped Waffle Bites** – crisp, buttery waffle pieces dipped in dark chocolate and topped with festive sprinkles.

> Our menu changes with the season and what sounds good in the oven that week,  
> so check the printed menu on the table for that day’s offerings.

## 🍵 Herbs & Teas  

![Loose leaf tea and teapot](/assets/images/market/tea-and-loaf.jpg)

We blend loose-leaf herbal teas and simple, comforting sips meant for quiet mornings, porch evenings, and everything in between.

- Loose-leaf blends with **rose petals, mint, citrus peel, and garden herbs**
- Gentle, naturally caffeine-free options for any time of day  
- Brewed samples at select markets, so you can taste before you take a jar home

All herbs and teas are labeled with ingredients so you can choose what fits your body best.

## 🌿 Plants, Soil & Green Companions  

![Indoor plant display](/assets/images/market/plant-table.jpg)

Our plant corner is for everyone who wants a bit more green in their life.

- **Indoor plants** in colorful ceramic pots
- **Succulents & aloe** for sunny windowsills
- **Sanctuary Soul / plant care goodies** to support healthy roots and leaves

Most plants are started, potted, or rehabbed by us, and we’re always happy to help you pick one that matches your light and care level.

## 🔥 Cozy Scents & Home Magic  

![Incense, crystals, and jars on wooden table](/assets/images/market/incense-crystals.jpg)

For the hearth side of Mystic Hearth, you’ll find:

- Glass jars of **incense sticks** in a variety of scents  
- **Candles** in reusable jars, poured in small batches
- Driftwood, macramé hangers, and other cozy touches to help build your own little altar or reading corner

These are meant to be everyday rituals: light a stick, breathe, and let the house feel a little softer.

## 🧵 Fiber Magic & Little Treasures  

![Macramé hangers and small fiber pieces](/assets/images/market/fiber-magic.jpg)

Our “fiber magic” is all the handmade string and cloth that sneaks onto the table:

- **Macramé plant hangers** to cradle your pots
- Small **tassels and garlands** for shelves and tables
- Occasional seasonal pieces (ornaments, charms, and other fiber experiments)

Each one is knotted and finished by hand, so no two are exactly alike.

---

## 🔮 Stones, Tools & Small Helps  

![Crystals and small tools on display](/assets/images/market/crystal-bowls.jpg)

We also keep a collection of pocket-sized helpers:

- Bowls of **tumbled stones and crystals**  
- Simple tools for rituals and grounding practices  
- Oils, sprays, or plant-care tonics (when in season)

Take what calls to you, or ask and we’ll help you choose a stone or tool that fits what you’re working on.

## 📍 Find Us In Person  

We set up at local markets around Bulverde / San Antonio, TX.

Look for:

- A white tent with a wooden **“The Mystic Hearth”** sign
- Tables full of brown paper bags, colorful pots, jars of herbs, and lots of smiles

Upcoming dates and locations are always posted on our socials and at the top of this page when we book them.

## 🤎 A Note From Our Hearth  

Everything you see on our tables is made, baked, blended, or grown by our family.  
When you bring something home from **The Mystic Hearth**, you’re taking home a little piece of that work and warmth.

Pull up a chair, pour some tea, light something that smells nice, and let your everyday life feel a bit more magical.
